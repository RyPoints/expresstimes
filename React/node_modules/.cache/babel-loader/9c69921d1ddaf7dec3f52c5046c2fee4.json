It is 6:30pm on a Thursday and it is officially Happy Hour. The atmosphere in the office is jovial and positive. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be? LoungeBuddy recently raised a $3M Series A round and launched their app on the Apple watch.</p><p>Founded to give travelers access to the best airport lounges around the world, LoungeBuddy is a company that was built around fun. Since it seems that they have figured out the secret to happy employees, I wanted to find out exactly what makes their company culture so great. I started the interview with one of LoungeBuddy&rsquo;s founders, Brent Griffith, with preconceived beliefs about the startup culture, but was surprised by the things I learned. </p><p>1. Hiring Is Critical I started off the interview by asking about the parties and trips that LoungeBuddy organizes for its employees, but the conversation was promptly steered to LoungeBuddy&rsquo;s most important aspect of culture. It turns out that the key to building an amazing culture, is to hire people that fit perfectly into your organization. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t find people that are dedicated, smart and passionate about what you are doing, if those interests are not aligned then it will not support a culture that you are trying to build,&rdquo; Brent states. The word &ldquo;passion&rdquo; was used countless times during my interview because it is, in fact, passion that builds that contagious enthusiasm which spreads to anyone that comes in contact with the company.</p><p>2. Cash Is King, or Is It? LoungeBuddy also has an answer for the complex question of structuring compensation. In order to align everyone&rsquo;s incentives they typically give multiple options (equity vs. cash compensation) to new hires. They prefer that everyone in the company has some equity. Flexible hours are also important in the tech world. LoungeBuddy employees typically start around 10 am to 11am and some engineers will stay until 3am. There have been internal discussion on acquiring a cot for those who just can&rsquo;t let go of their code. The proposal was vetoed to avoid burnout and preserve a fun working environment.</p><p>3. Keep the Party Going Ok, we finally got to the part that I wanted to hear about, the parties! Two of the founders met organizing events in Las Vegas for an electronics show. The third founder they met at one of their parties. So, to say that these people know how to have fun, would be an understatement. Previously working at The VAULT, a coworking space, the team had access to all of the events planned by the space. The happy hours, lunch demos and VAULT organized trips were a great way to bond with the team. Today, having their own office, the founders handle event planning on their own.</p><p>Brent told me about their recent company retreat to Puerto Vallarta. The team worked really hard for 6 to 12 months, hit a number of milestones and accomplished a great deal. Employees were told to pack for a certain climate and to show up at the airport. At their arrival, the secret retreat location was revealed. The trip was very cost effective and it presented a great opportunity to bond outside of the office. In the last six months, founders have organized other team events such as sailing on the bay, SF Giants games, the symphony, an African dinner and miniature golf outing.</p><p>4. What Really Makes Us Tick A huge motivator for most of us is growth. That&rsquo;s why LoungeBuddy cross-trains the members and helps them improve their skills. They make sure to give people opportunities to develop themselves and get exposure to the different areas of the company. &ldquo;Showing that you care and putting effort into helping other people to improve is key&rdquo; says Brent. Also, keeping the organization flat allows people to have a voice and reduce uncertainty through transparency.</p><p>5. Lose the Battle, Win the War Studies show that the number one reason for startup failure is disagreement between founders. When asked how the three serial entrepreneurs handle the challenge, Brent states: &ldquo;We have done a good job respecting each other&rsquo;s opinions&#8230; Because we are aligned to find the best solution, we work toward a creative way of addressing problems.&rdquo;</p><p>So, there you have it. The key to a successful company is building a culture that is driven by passion, growth, respect, goal alignment and, most importantly, fun. This approach has clearly paid off as the company has experienced great success in not only raising funds but gaining traction. LoungeBuddy is currently growing and is hiring engineering talent.</p>'\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  title: 'What is LoungeBuddy?',\n  article: '<p>LoungeBuddy is an airport lounge booking platform that allows you to reserve access into airport lounges regardless of your elite status, lounge memberships, or class of service.
